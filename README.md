Second task from C# courses

1. Mandatory task*. The length L of a circle is given. Find its radius R and the area S of the circle bounded by this circle.
2. The coordinates of two opposite vertices of the rectangle are given: (x1, y1), (x2, y2). 
	The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. 
	Find the perimeter and area of this rectangle.
3. The coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle are given: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3). 
	Find its perimeter and area using the formula for the distance between two points on a plane. 
	To find the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, use Heronâ€™s formula.
